# 🚀 Production Launch Checklist

This checklist should be completed **before launching publicly** or when you hit **100+ users**.

## ⚠️ Critical Security Items

### 1. 🔒 **UPGRADE STORAGE TO SECURE POLICIES** 
**Status:** ⏳ Pending  
**Priority:** 🔴 **HIGH** - Must do before public launch

**Why:** Current storage allows anyone to access recording URLs. This is a privacy risk.

**Steps:**
1. Run `src/lib/supabase/storage-schema-secure.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Replace `src/lib/storage/audio.ts` with `src/lib/storage/audio-secure.ts`
3. Test upload and playback still work
4. Update API routes if needed

**Files to review:**
- `src/lib/supabase/storage-schema-secure.sql` (new schema)
- `src/lib/storage/audio-secure.ts` (secure version with signed URLs)

---

### 2. 🔑 Environment Variables Audit
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

- [ ] All API keys are set in production environment
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No secrets committed to git
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies are all enabled

---

### 3. 🛡️ Rate Limiting
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

Add rate limiting for:
- [ ] Audio uploads (prevent spam)
- [ ] API endpoints (prevent abuse)
- [ ] Guest session creation (prevent quota exhaustion)

Consider: [Upstash Rate Limit](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/features/ratelimiting) or Vercel Edge Config

### 4. 🗑️ Storage Cleanup Jobs
**Status:** ⏳ Pending

Use Supabase Edge Functions or cron jobs.
