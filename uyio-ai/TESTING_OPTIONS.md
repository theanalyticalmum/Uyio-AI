# üß™ Testing Options - Let Others Try Your App

## Option 1: Free Hosting with Subdomain (Recommended) ‚≠ê

### Deploy to Vercel (Free Subdomain)
**No domain needed! Get: `uyio-ai.vercel.app`**

## Option 2: Localhost Tunnel (Quick Testing) üöá

### Use ngrok (5 minutes setup)

**What it does**: Makes your `localhost:3000` accessible via public URL

```bash
# Install ngrok
brew install ngrok  # Mac
# or download from https://ngrok.com

# Start your app
npm run dev

# In another terminal, create tunnel
ngrok http 3000

# You'll get: https://abc123.ngrok.io
# Share this URL!
```

**Pros**: 
- Instant (no deployment)
- Test local changes immediately
- Great for quick demos

**Cons**:
- Your computer must stay running
- URL changes each time (unless paid)
- Limited to 40 connections/min (free tier)

---

### Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Free, Better)

```bash
# Install
brew install cloudflared

# Start tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000

# Get: https://xyz.trycloudflare.com
```

**Pros**:
- No signup required
- Unlimited connections
- Fast

**Cons**:
- URL changes each time
- Computer must stay on

---

## Option 3: Share Locally on Same Network üì±

**For testing with people in same location (office, home)**

```bash
# Find your local IP
# Mac/Linux:
ifconfig | grep "inet "

# You'll see something like: 192.168.1.100

# Start your app
npm run dev

# Others on same WiFi can visit:
http://192.168.1.100:3000
```

**Pros**: 
- Instant
- No setup
- Free

**Cons**:
- Only works on same WiFi network
- Not good for remote testers

## Option 4: Video Demo üé•

**If you can't give live access yet:**

1. Record screen with:
   - Loom (free, easy)
   - QuickTime (Mac)
   - OBS (free, powerful)

2. Show:
   - Homepage
   - Guest practice flow
   - AI feedback results
   - Dashboard

3. Share video link

**Great for**: Getting feedback before deploying
